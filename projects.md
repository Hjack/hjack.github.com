	<h3><a href="http://hoodies.portlandcodeschool.com/">The Awesome Hoodie Project</a></h3>
  <p>
  	I helped to re-construct a philanthropic web site designed to sell hooded sweatshirts.  A portion of the proceeds from each hoodie will be donated to local coding organizations focused on education and community events.

  <h3><a href="https://github.com/Hjack/kata">Programming Exercises</a></h3>
  <p>
  	This is a collection of warm up exercises I do to enhance my programming abilities.  It's nothing major...just me practicing coding.
