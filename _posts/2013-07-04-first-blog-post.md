Week 5 of the Portland Code School was short due to Independence Day.  Although it was a short week, it was extremely busy.  I began working with Ruby on Rails and Sinatra this week.  It felt good to be able to finally dive into these frameworks.  The previous 4 weeks have been interesting and I'm glad to be at the point of building an actual web application.

In addition to learning Rails and Sinatra, we also formed groups for a 4 week project.  I'm looking forward to my group and I contributing to an open source project soon!
