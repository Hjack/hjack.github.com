Today my fellow Portland Code School students and I took a tour of New Relic's office in downtown Portland.  The view from their office is as impressive as the technology they provide.

Earlier this year, New Relic raised $80 million in capital.  The application performance management software New Relic provides helps companies like HP Cloud Services, Amazon Web Services and Engine Yard maintain high performance apps in the cloud.
