I'm pleased to be working on developing a website for the Awesome Hoodie Project.  The project is a commerce website selling hooded sweatshirts designed to benefit several non-profit and community organizations in Portland.  The organizations involved in the project are Portland Code School, PDX.rb, Stumptown Syndicate and Code Scouts.  Part of the proceeds from hoodie sales will be used to help educate the tech community in Portland.

The website was created in Sinatra.  We’ve used JavaScript and jQuery for the front end along with a data model using DataMapper and SQLite.  We’ve also implemented payment processing through PayPal’s API.

I’m excited to be a part of the project and look forward to contributing to this great cause!
