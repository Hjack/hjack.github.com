  	A native of southern California, I have spent the last 13 years in the Northwest.  After spending 16 years in media sales, I decided to transition to web development to satisfy my need to analyze and natural inquisitiveness.  When I am not busy coding, I enjoy spending time with my two wonderful children, listening to music and watching sports.
